Simple mod that adds new types of platforms for your arena or construction needs.
Currently adds 12 new platforms:
Dirt Platform
Stone Platform
Asphalt Platform (Provides same move speed as Asphalt Blocks)
Red Brick Platform
Mud Platform
Pearlstone Brick Platform
Ebonstone Brick Platform
Crimstone Brick Platform
Sandstone Brick Platform
Infused Honey Platform (Provides Honey Buff)
Poo Platform (Makes you stink)
RainbowBrick Platform

All of these platforms have quick placement so you can run at max speed while placing them.
The dirt and stone platform are mostly for arena building since cutting down your entire worlds supply of wood for platforms isn't very cash money.
